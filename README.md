# Elixir Starters

## What?

Elixir Starters is a small website that shows all Github issues labeled with "Level:Starter" 
on repos written (mostly) in Elixir.

## Okay, but, what's the purpose?

I started learning Elixir (and Phoenix) about 2 months ago and I've always wanted
to contribute to a brand new ecosystem. So, this was my chance. As a beginner, I 
searched for issues that I could fix in the more popular Elixir repos. I noticed that
some repos use the label "Level:Starter" for issues that can be solved by beginners.

This is a great practice. Beginners can contribute and learn a lot while more experienced
maintainers/contributors can focus on harder issues of the software. So, I came up
with Elixir Starters. It's basically a quick hack at the problem.

## How does it work?

Built with HTML and JavaScript (Angular.js) hosted on Github Pages. 

## Can I help?

**Yes, you can!** 

I am a backend developer, so my design chops are not great (as you can see). So,
if you feel that you can contribute in the UI/UX of the site, or, in any other way
feel free to fork and submit a pull request.
